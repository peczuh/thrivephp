	/**
	 * Query access control for users and roles.
	 *
	 * There are four database tables involved in access control:
	 * - roles table: The roles table is a list of roles that can be assigned to users.
	 * - users_roles: The users_roles table stores all the roles assigned to users.
	 * - acl_keys: The acl_keys table is a list of items that represent things for which
	 *    access should be controlled. Most keys represent a database tables or data objects.
	 * - acl_permissions: The acl_permissions table stores the permissions granted permissions
	 *    granted for a key to a role.
	 *
	 * Example: Johnny Appleseed is a sales manager and needs permissions to create, edit, and
	 * delete estimates for himself and his team. Johnny will need to be assigned the Sales Manager role.
	 * And the Sales Manager role should be given access to the key `data.estimates` and permission grants
	 * of `select`, `update`, `create`, `delete`, and `manager`.
	 *

		 * - ACL::create
		 * - ACL::delete

		 * - ACL::admin
		 *
		 * @param uuid $userId The user's ID from the `users` database table.
